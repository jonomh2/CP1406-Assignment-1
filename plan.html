CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan

Name: Jonathan Hall

Goals

The purpose of this website is to draw a younger, teenage demographic, through vibrant and aesthetically appealing web design.
The site is also aiming to improve the customer base by at least 50% through use of an engaging layout and simple, easy to use design.

Success Evaluation

The aim of this website is to draw in a younger, teenage base and to see an increase in customers by at least 50%.
To evaluate the website's success, we should see an increase in teenagers signing up, and also the full customer base increase by at least 50%.

Target Audience

The target audience for this website is primarily teenagers and young adults.
The design for the website in turn will be colourful, vibrant (without forfeiting usability) and will not contain a lot of text, on the main page.
This is in contrast to a more formal, organised and less colourful website that would be aimed at adults or seniors.
